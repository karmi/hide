p. *elasticsearch* codebase is hosted on "github":github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch, and its just a @fork@ away. To get started with the code, start by either forking or cloning the repo. One can also just download the master code in either "zip":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/tarball/master or "tar.gz":https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/zipball/master.

p. Once downloaded, building an elasticsearch distribution is simple. From within the source, run:

<pre class="prettify">
$ gradlew
</pre>

p. If you are running it for the first time, go get a cup of coffee (or bet yet, a beer), it will take some time to download all the dependencies *elasticsearch* has. Once finished, a full distribution of the elasticsearch will be created under @build/distributions@.

p. In order to use it, just get either the @zip@ or @tar.gz@ installation, extract it, and fire up @elasticsearch -f@. You now have a fully functional master based *elasticsearch* version running.

h1. Hacking

p. *elasticsearch* comes with built in "IntelliJ IDEA":http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ project files. Just download the "community edition":http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/, fire it up, and import the project.

p. In order to get all the dependencies right, you will need to run @gradle@ and also @gradle test@ once to download all the dependencies.
