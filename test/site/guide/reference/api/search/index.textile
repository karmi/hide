p. The search API allows to execute a search query and get back search hits that match the query. It can be executed across "indices and types":indices-types.html. The query can either be provided using a simple "query string as a parameter":uri-request.html, or using a "request body":request-body.html.

h1. Routing

p. When executing a search, it will be broadcasted to all the index/indices shards (round robin between replicas). Which shards will be searched on can be controlled by providing the @routing@ parameter. For example, when indexing tweets, the routing value can be the user name:  

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet?routing=kimchy' -d '{
    "user" : "kimchy",
    "postDate" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12",
    "message" : "trying out Elastic Search"
}
'
</pre>

p. In such a case, if we want to search only on the tweets for a specific user, we can specify it as the routing, resulting in the search hitting only the relevant shard:

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_search?routing=kimchy' -d '{
    "filtered" : {
        "query" : {
            "query_string" : {
                "query" : "some query string here"
            }
        },
        "filter" : {
            "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" }
        }
    }
}
'
</pre>

p. The routing parameter can be multi valued represented as a comma separated string. This will result in hitting the relevant shards where the routing values match to.
