title: Search API - Named Filters

p. Each filter can accept a _name in its top level definition, for example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "filtered" : {
        "query" : {
            "term" : { "name.first" : "shay" }
        },
        "filter" : {
            "terms" : {
                "name.last" : ["banon", "kimchy"],
                "_name" : "test"
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. The search response will include for each hit the @matched_filters@ it matched on (note, this feature make sense for @or@ / @bool@ filters).

p. Note, the query filter had to be enhanced in order to support this. In order to set a name, the @fquery@ filter should be used, which wraps a query (just so there will be a place to set a name for it), for example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "filtered" : {
        "query" : {
            "term" : { "name.first" : "shay" }
        },
        "filter" : {
            "fquery" : {
                "query" : {
                    "term" : { "name.last" : "banon" }
                },
                "_name" : "test"
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
