p. The http module allows to expose *elasticsearch* "API":/guide/reference/api over HTTP.

p. The http mechanism is completely asynchronous in nature, meaning that there is no blocking thread waiting for a response. The benefit of using asynchronous communication for HTTP is solving the "C10k problem":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem.

p. When possible, consider using "HTTP keep alive":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keepalive#HTTP_Keepalive when connecting for better performance and try to get your favorite client not to do "HTTP chunking":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding.

h1. Settings

p. The following are the settings the can be configured for HTTP:

|_. Setting |_. Description |
|@http.port@|A bind port range. Defaults to @9200-9300@.|
|@http.max_content_length@|The max content of an HTTP request. Defaults to @100mb@|

p. It also shares the uses the common "network settings":network.html.

h1. Disable HTTP

p. The http module can be completely disabled and not started by setting @http.enabled@ to @false@. This make sense when creating non "data nodes":node.html which accept HTTP requests, and communicate with data nodes using the internal "transport":transport.html.
