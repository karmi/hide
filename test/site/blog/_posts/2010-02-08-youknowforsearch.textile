p. ElasticSearch is an open source, distributed, RESTful, search engine which is built on top of "Lucene":http://lucene.apache.org internally and enjoys all the features it provides.

p. All the features it has are listed in the "overview page":/products/elasticsearch, so no need to list them here again (with the extra splash, if I might add). ElasticSearch itself was born out of my frustration with the fact that there isn't really a good, open source, solution for distributed search engine out there, which also combines what I expect of search engines after building "Compass":http://www.compass-project.org (and on that, I will blog later...).

p. I have been working on this for the past several months, pouring my search and distributed knowledge into this (and portions of my heart and time ;) ), Enjoy!.
